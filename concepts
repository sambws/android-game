IDEAS:
FOR THINGS LIKE EXPLOSIONS, CREATE A PARTICLE TABLE
ADD THINGS TO THE TABLE, AND THEN ADD THE TABLE TO ENTITIES (WHICH WILL DRAW/UPDATE THEM)
MAKE EACH PARTICLE HAVE IT'S OWN RANDOMLY GENERATED STRING NAME

DELETING INDIVIDUAL PARTICLES:
WHEN OPACITY IS 0
LOOP THROUGH ALL ENTITIES AND LOOK FOR THE PART'S NAME
IF E.NAME = SELF.NAME THEN
	table.remove(ents, i)
